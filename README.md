## Installation

```sh
pip install devjournal
```

## Configuration

The default directory for storing configuration and journal entries is `~/.devjournal`.
This can be overridden with the `DEVJOURNAL_DIR` environment variable.

If running on Windows, consider setting the environment variable `EDITOR` to an editor
of your choice, to make devjournal use that editor when editing journal entries.

## Usage

### Adding new journal entry

```sh
$ dj add
```

This command will open the entry in the editor specified by the environment variable 
`EDITOR`. If that variable is not set, it will use the `start` command instead, which 
on Windows opens the editor for .txt files (by default Notepad).

Alternatively, you can add the text of the entry directly on the command line:

```sh
$ dj add This is my journal entry
```
### Showing all entries

```sh
$ dj log
2022-12-25 16:15:56.536078

add hello world
```

### Show only entries containing any of the search terms

```sh
$ dj find hello
2022-12-25 16:15:56.536078

add hello world
```


## Developing

```sh
# Setup pre-commit and pre-push hooks
hatch run pre-commit install -t pre-commit
hatch run pre-commit install -t pre-push
```

### Running tests

```sh
hatch run cov
```

## Roadmap

- sync with repo
- Replace find and log with a browser
   - Features: 
     - filtering entries by text
     - filtering entries by 
     - options for selecting a certain entry 
     - editing the selected entry
   - Can textual be used?
     - textual does not work very well in the vscode terminal, so perhaps not.
- Investigate if multiple entries from the same day should be combined under the same
  heading, and if so if they should only show the date and not the time.
